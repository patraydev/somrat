I'm Pat Ray, Full-Stack Web Developer. I'm coming in hot from an industry-leading coding bootcamp with a background in management at a James Beard award-winning high-volume cocktail bar; my goal is and has always been to set up my team with the tools that they need to maximize profits while  providing world-class experiences. 

I'm looking to continue to grow my technical skills and use my hard-won industry experience and skills in a new context - let's connect!
