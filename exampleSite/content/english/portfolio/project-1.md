#### Project Details

This project will pull data from the city of Chicago Open Data Project and create a dynamically updated, easy-to read, open source, and add-free tracker of the percentage of Chicago residents vaccinated against COVID-19 by zip code.

#### Project Goals

MVP will be a display of the percent of Chicago population vaccinated, updated on a daily basis, followed by a tabular listing of all zip codes and percentages.

PostMVP will add expandable data on each zip code and a search bar.
