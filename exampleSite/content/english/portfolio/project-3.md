#### Project Details

For this project we worked with West Town Bikes, a Chicago area youth-focused nonprofit, to create a digital inventory of bikes for Ciclo Urbano, their brick-and-mortar storefront. Our application allows users to browse in-stock bikes without having to visit the shop in person or call, which were the only previous ways.

#### Project Goals

* Full Frontend CRUD functionality
* Full Backend CRUD functionality
* User authorization implemented (site admins can sign up/sign in)
* Landing Page Carousel displays featured bikes
* Responsive design
* Navigation bar
* Search bar
*
